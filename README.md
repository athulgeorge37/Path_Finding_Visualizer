# Path Finding Visualizer

Description: 

- Finds the shortest distance between 2 points using different graph searching algorithms.
- Incoporates a variety of maze generation algorithms.
- User can also place weights of varying costs on any graph cell.
- Also implements many quality of life improvements and extra features, over similar existing projects.
