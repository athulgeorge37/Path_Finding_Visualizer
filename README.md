# Path Finding Visualizer

Description: 

- Finds the shortest distance between 2 points using different graph searching algorithms.
- Incoporates a variety of maze generation algorithms.
- User can also place weights of varying costs on any graph cell.
- Also implements many quality of life improvements and extra features, over similar projects.

## Demo:
See the live demo [here](https://athulgeorge37.github.io/Path_Finding_Visualizer/)

- I was inspired by Clement's [Path Finding Visualizer](https://clementmihailescu.github.io/Pathfinding-Visualizer/)
- and from a previous [project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eu465Jue3ns) I had made eariler that involves path finding in the third dimension.
